                She's got a smile that it seems to me
                Reminds me of childhood memories
                Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
                Now and then when I see her face
                She takes me away to that special place
                And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry

                Woah, oh, oh
                Sweet child o' mine
                oah, oh, oh, oh
                Sweet love of mine

                She's got eyes of the bluest skies
                As if they thought of rain
                I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
                Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
                Where, as a child, I'd hide
                And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by
                
                Woah, oh, oh
                Sweet child o' mine
                Woah woah, oh, oh, oh
                Sweet love of mine

                Ohh!

                Oh, oh-oh-yeah
                Woah, yeah
                Woah, oh, h-o
                Sweet child of mine
                Woah-oh, woah-oh
                Sweet love of mine
                Woah, oh-oh-oh
                Sweet child of mine, ooh, yeah
                Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
                Sweet love of mine

                Where do we go?
                Where do we go now?
                Where do we go?
                Mm-mm, oh, where do we go?
                Where do we go now?
                Oh, where do we go now? (Where do we go?)
                Where do we go? (Sweet child of mine)
                Mm-huh, where do we go now?
                Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye (Where do we go? Where do we go?)
                Ooh, where do we go now? (Where do we go?)
                Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, woah
                Where do we go?
                Oh-oh, where do we go now?
                (Oh) Where do we go, oh-oh-oh-oh? (Oh, wow)
                Where do we go now?
                Where do we go?
                Woah-oh, where do we go now?
                No, no, no, no, no, no, no
                Sweet child
                Sweet child of mine
