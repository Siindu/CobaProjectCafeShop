        <h4>Lyrics:</h4>
        <pre>
            She's got a smile that it seems to me
            Reminds me of childhood memories
            Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
            Now and then when I see her face
            She takes me away to that special place
            And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry

            Woah, oh, oh
            Sweet child o' mine
            oah, oh, oh, oh
            Sweet love of mine

            She's got eyes of the bluest skies
            As if they thought of rain
            I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
            Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
            Where, as a child, I'd hide
            And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by
            
            Woah, oh, oh
            Sweet child o' mine
            Woah woah, oh, oh, oh
            Sweet love of mine

            Ohh!

            Oh, oh-oh-yeah
            Woah, yeah
            Woah, oh, h-o
            Sweet child of mine
            Woah-oh, woah-oh
            Sweet love of mine
            Woah, oh-oh-oh
            Sweet child of mine, ooh, yeah
            Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
            Sweet love of mine

            Where do we go?
            Where do we go now?
            Where do we go?
            Mm-mm, oh, where do we go?
            Where do we go now?
            Oh, where do we go now? (Where do we go?)
            Where do we go? (Sweet child of mine)
            Mm-huh, where do we go now?
            Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye (Where do we go? Where do we go?)
            Ooh, where do we go now? (Where do we go?)
            Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, woah
            Where do we go?
            Oh-oh, where do we go now?
            (Oh) Where do we go, oh-oh-oh-oh? (Oh, wow)
            Where do we go now?
            Where do we go?
            Woah-oh, where do we go now?
            No, no, no, no, no, no, no
            Sweet child
            Sweet child of mine
