                If we could see tomorrow, what are your plans?<br>
                No one can live in sorrow, ask all your friends <br>
                Times that you took in stride they're back in demand <br>
                I was the one who's washing blood off your hands <br><br>

                Don't you cry tonight <br>
                I still love you, baby <br>
                Don't you cry tonight <br>
                Don't you cry tonight <br>
                There's a heaven above you, baby <br>
                 And don't you cry tonight <br> <br>

                I know the things you wanted, they're not what you have <br>
                With all the people talkin', it's drivin' you mad <br>
                If I was standin' by you, how would you feel? <br>
                Knowing your love's decided and all love is real, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby <br>
                And don't you cry tonight <br>

                Don't you cry tonight <br>
                Don't you cry tonight <br>
                There's a heaven above you baby <br>
                And don't you cry tonight <br><br>
                
                I thought I could live in your world as years all went by <br>
                With all the voices I've heard something has died <br>
                And when you're in need of someone, my heart won't deny you <br>
                So many seem so lonely with no one left to cry to, baby <br><br>
                
                And don't you cry tonight <br>
                And don't you cry tonight <br>
                And don't you cry tonight <br>
                There's a heaven above you baby <br><br>

                And don't you cry <br>
                Don't you ever cry <br>
                Don't you cry, tonight <br>
                Baby, baby, someday <br><br>

                Don't you cry <br>
                Don't you ever cry <br>
                Don't you cry tonight <br>
